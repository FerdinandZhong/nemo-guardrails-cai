# NeMo Guardrails Deployment Jobs Configuration
#
# This configuration defines the job sequence for deploying NeMo Guardrails on CAI:
# 1. git_sync: Pull latest code from repository
# 2. setup_environment: Create Python venv and install NeMo Guardrails
# 3. launch_guardrails: Start the guardrails server as a CAI Application
#
# Note on Script Entry Points:
# - All scripts must be file paths relative to project root (e.g., "cai_integration/script.py")
# - CAI API does not support inline scripts or command prefixes
# - git_sync: Bash script that pulls repository
# - setup_environment: Python script that creates the venv
# - launch_guardrails: Python script that creates CAI Application via REST API
#
# Job Dependencies (handled automatically by CAI):
# - setup_environment (root) → launch_guardrails (child)
# - When root job succeeds, child jobs auto-trigger automatically
# - We only trigger the root job via trigger_jobs.py
#
# Note: git_sync job is optional and can be added later for updates
# Initial deployment doesn't need git_sync since setup_project.py clones the repo
